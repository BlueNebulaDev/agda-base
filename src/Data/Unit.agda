-- An empty record type is a record type with no fields. Unit is the "official"

-- A thunk is a value wrapped inside a function that takes "no arguments".
-- Another way to think about thunk is as the fold operation for Unit
-- (considered as a type with one constructor).

-- The inverse of thunk is unthunk. Together, these two functions witness an
-- isomorphism between Unit -> X and X. They also prove that the identity
-- functor id {{Sets}} is representable by Unit.
